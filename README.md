# FitBoss1

This project was developed in full from ideation to final implimentation during the QHacks 22' hackathon
I worked on this project with fellow engineering students, the idea came from group members who felt they needed a way to stay committed to fitness while stuck at home caused by gym closure due to rising covid cases at the time in kingston. 
With this app, people would be able to work out and improve their characters abilities through exercise.
A key inspiration to this game was the popular game, Pokemon Go, which also encuoraged community and fitness through a mobile app. This app was developed to a minimum viable product in the 24 hours given for the hackathon. It includes the ability to track your workouts with specific workouts adding defined values to statistics of the player. These stats are used to defeat bosses which would get stronger as you progress through them.
